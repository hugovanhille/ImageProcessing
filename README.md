# ImageProcessing

## Dataset
You can download the datasets we used on this website
http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/

## Add noise
The file The file [noise.py](https://github.com/hugovanhille/ImageProgressing/noise.py)  include the code we used to add noise to a dataset present in local folders

## Denoising method 

The file [lowPassFilter.py](https://github.com/hugovanhille/ImageProgressing/lowPassFilter.py) include the script used to test the method Spatial frequency filtering.
.

The file [wavelet.py](https://github.com/hugovanhille/ImageProgressing/wavelet.py) include the script used to test the method wavelet domain filtering.

## Metrics Performance

## Deep Neural Network (DNN)
The file [trainNN.py](https://github.com/hugovanhille/ImageProgressing/trainNN.py) contain the code to ttrain the NN we used as well as the code to do inferences on dataset in order to determine the accuracy of the validation dataset after denoising by the different methods.
